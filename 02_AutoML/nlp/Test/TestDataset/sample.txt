Service is also cute.
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
So they performed.
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.
